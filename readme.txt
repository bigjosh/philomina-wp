== Description ==
Philomina is a clean and minimalistic theme perfect for fashion blogs or websites that make a huge use of quality photographs. Its accessible on all screen sizes, and it's optimised to support multiple translations. We added some nice load and unload effects throughout the site and added a lightbox feature for the images. We've limited customisation at this time but we welcome any suggestions and if reasonable we will include it in the next update.
